The lartpc2D project focuses on applying reinforcement learning to solve problems in high energy physics, specifically using deep Q-learning. The project aims to model the behavior of particles in a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detector. Here are some key points:

Objective: To use reinforcement learning to simulate particle interactions within a LArTPC detector.
Approach:
An agent navigates through a 2D grid representing the detector, with the ability to move in 8 directions.
The agent’s visible frame consists of a 3x3 window of pixels, which it uses to classify and map the environment.
The agent iteratively categorizes pixels and updates a blank canvas with the detected classes.
Advantages:
This method closely mimics the actual detection process.
It allows for iterative and parallel processing.
The approach can be extended to include time dimensions and multiple agents.
Implementation:
The project uses datasets from deeplearnphysics.org.
The basic implementation involves deep Q-learning with two inputs and two outputs1.

The gym-lartpc2d project is an extension of the lartpc2D project, designed to integrate with OpenAI’s Gym environment. This allows for standardized reinforcement learning experiments and easier benchmarking. Key aspects include:

Objective: To provide a Gym-compatible environment for reinforcement learning experiments on LArTPC data.
Features:
Integration with OpenAI Gym for standardized RL experiments.
Customizable environment settings to simulate different detector conditions.
Support for various RL algorithms to test and compare performance.
Usage:
Researchers can use this environment to train and evaluate RL models on LArTPC data.
The environment is designed to be flexible and extendable for different research needs2.
