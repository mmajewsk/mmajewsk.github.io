Hi.

I am Maciej, and I like coding stuff.

I have graduated with Master of Science degree in Computer Science at AGH UST (speciality: Data modelling and analysis).

Currently, I am a physics PhD student, and a member of [LHCb collaboration](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/) @ [CERN](https://home.cern/).

I also teach "Python in the Enterprise" course at my Uni.

My experience with machine learning started with circa 2013, with participation in kaggle competitions.
So far the core of my work with AI/ML was centered around LHCb's VELO detector, you can find some published papers on that topic on my ORCID page.

I am also developing some of the software for the LHCb's VELO in run III.
Additionally I am working on application of reinforcement learning for high energy physics in lartpc dataset.
In my spare time I enjoy working on my project of autonomous vehicle, written in python.
If you are interested in any of the above, see the list of my projects [here](https://mmajewsk.github.io/projects/). 

I am also one of the organisers of PyData KrakÃ³w [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/PyData-Krakow/), as well as [Intellinet AGH](http://www.intelli-net.agh.edu.pl/forum-intelli-net/).

My interests that do not overlap with my profession are;
- Music (guitar, ukulele, and others)
- Trekking (usually in the southern Poland)
- Travel
