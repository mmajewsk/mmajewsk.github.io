Hi.

I am Maciej, and I love AI and science. 

In fact I love those two topics so much, I have PhD in application of machine learning to science problems - specifically high energy physics (some call it particle physics).
I made some cools stuff for the [CERN](https://home.cern/) [LHCb collaboration](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/) (yeah, that's the one with the big circle thingy called Large Hadron Collider). 
By the way you can read entiety of my PhD online here: [phd_link](https://github.com/mmajewsk/phd_thesis_mmajewski) 

My interest in science lays mainly in solving problems with using code and AI, this is why I have Master of Science degree in Computer Science at AGH UST.

I like to share my passion for cool things:
 - I teach "Python in the Enterprise" course at AGH UST in Kraków.
 - I am also one of the organisers of PyData Kraków [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/PyData-Krakow/) - check it out to see the next event.
 - ... and soon other opportunities to be announced soon

My professional experiences are vast, and I plan to describe them in the "projects" section of this page soon, but let me give you a gist:
 - My experience with machine learning started with circa 2013, with participation in kaggle competitions.
 - In 2014 I worked for a small startup, and worked on analyzing the data from sensors aboard a gyroplane.
 - I have been involved with the LHCb's velo detector since 2015, and doing cool software for it since then till 2023. Stuff like: calibration monitoring, database - but also things needing an machine learning approach anomaly detection, need of calibration forecast, dimentionality reduction, and a nice method for finding unruly pixels in new VeloPix detector. I lead teams consisting of many students that participated in those effors.
 - During the classes that I have been giving, all of the students were creating their own projects in groups. That gave me amazing oportuninty to quickly gain managing skills, and really in the end I learned from them a lot when it comes to creating projects that involve machine learning, not only on the technical level, but also as someone who oversees a team effort.
