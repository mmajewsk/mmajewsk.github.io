## Hello there

I am Maciej, and I love AI and science. 

## Professional experience

My professional history includes thrilling experiences such as:

- Competing in Kaggle competitions and gaining experience in ML **since 2013**
- Work with IMU sensors, and in robotics company.
- **Gaining a 100 000 PLN** [grant](https://projekty.ncn.gov.pl/index.php?projekt_id=395312) from [Polish National Science Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Centre)
- Mentoring hundreds of projects during the "Python In The Enterprise" course on AGH University of Science and Technology
- **Obtaining PhD**, and working on the cutting-edge science in one of the biggest scientific facilities in the world (see Science section).
- Gaining experience as Data-Scientist in various companies.
- Leading a research team at startup (Omniaz), and leading teams in various projects for LHCb collaboration, and AGH University.
- Being responsible for consulting on the grant application (NCBIR) in [Łukasiewicz Research Network](https://lukasiewicz.gov.pl/en/) in Poznań 

## Science

After obtaining Masters Degree in Computer Science in 2016,  and until 2023 I have been working in a PhD in application of machine learning to science problems. Specifically I was interested in the topic of applying machine learning to high energy physics (some call it particle physics). 
You can see the entirity of the PhD dissertation here: [phd_link](https://github.com/mmajewsk/phd_thesis_mmajewski). **I was working in [CERN](https://home.cern/)**, with the [LHCb collaboration](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/) which is located on the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) - likely the biggest manmade machine.

## Other activity

I like to share my passion for cool things:
 - I teach "Python in the Enterprise" course at AGH UST in Kraków.
 - I am also one of the organisers of **PyData Kraków** [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/PyData-Krakow/) - check it out to see the next event.
 - ... and soon other opportunities to be announced
